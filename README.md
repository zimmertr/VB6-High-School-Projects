#VB6 - High School Projects

##Foreward
**PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I WAS 14 YEARS OLD WHILE MAKING THESE PROJECTS**

These projects do not use current technology, reflect a good programming methodology or understanding, or use modern subject matter. I simply put thse on GitHub as a friendly reminder to myself of where I came from as well as a `trophy` of sorts to demonstrate how long computer programming has been an important part of my life. 

##Summary
This repository is a collection of my homework, projects, and labs from my computer programming class in high school around 2008. All of these projects were written in Visual Basic 6.0. They all safely compile in run in Visual Studio 2015 after an upgrade, however. 

###Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. Players take turn clicking a green square which is marked with an `X` or an `O` depending on the player. When a win is detected, the related squares will turn from green to yellow to represent the win to the players. At any time the players can elect to restart the game or quit.

###Calculator

A simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and decimal points. Like many other characters, you simply choose the mathematical expression you wish to calculate and hit enter to see the result. Hitting clear will reset the calculator to its initial state.

###Thanksgiving Program

Thanksgiving Program is a program that uses an algorithm based on two inputs: the `weight` of a turkey and whether or not it is `stuffed`. Using these two inputs, it calculates the amount of time that a turkey should be cooked for a Thanksgiving dinner when you press `OK`.

###If.Then Project

The If.Then project was a project used to learn how conditional statements work. You are prompted to answer what the state capital of Michigan is. If you choose a wrong answer, the program gives you a childish insult. Ironically, it has a spelling error in it as well. If you give the right answer, it also insults you. 14 year old humor, aye?

###My First Program

My First Program was a program used to learn how buttons, textboxes, and labels work together. If you push the `What is Your name?` button, a hardcoded label appears on the form. If you push the `How Old are You?` button, my age appears in the textbox. If you click `That's all Folks`, a popup box appears that says `Bye Bye`, and the program exits when you click `OK`.

###Grade Calculator

This program was inteded to take in a multitude of inputs and calculate your final grade for a class. It doesn't compile in a modern day IDE so I assume it was never finished.
